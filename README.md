# matasano-challenges
My solutions to the Matasano crypto challenges, you can find out more about
them [here](http://cryptopals.com).

I'm using [Golang](http://golang.org) to solve the challenges as a learning
exercise as I've never used the language before.

I'll be publishing more detail about my thought process and how I solved each
challenge on [my blog](http://nate.aero).
